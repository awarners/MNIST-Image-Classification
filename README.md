# MNIST Image Classification

This project was conducted for the Erasmus School of Economics. This repository contains the code used to compare the performance of multiple image classifiers.

## About the project

Aims to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST database, using a (Convolutional) Neural Network. The (Convolutional) Neural Networks are evaluated by using other (simple) classifiers as a benchmark.

## Classifiers

Simple classifiers:
* Linear Classifier
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Decision Tree

Advanced classifiers:
* Random Forrest
* Feedforward Neural Network
* Convolutional Neural Network

## Authors

* **Gianni Brauwers** 
* **Hien Ngo** 
* **Mark Riezebos** 
* **Aura Warners** 

## Acknowledgments

We would like to thank our supervisor dr. Phyllis Wan for her support and encouragement during this project.
